Demonstration of Test Driven Development using MUnit 2.0

This respository contains step by step commits demonstrating TDD, a failure commit followed by a successful commit.
A few test cases are not mocked, to make them work please download a local dependency of H2 and run it as a server and execute the sql scripts that are placed in resource folder.

For demonstration purpose I have uploaded a series of videos on youtube, please use the below link to navigate:
